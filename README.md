## Incomplete Solvers

### Time complexity based on Firewall1 variant

90 online fixing instances of increasing size have been generated from _Firewall1_ by selecting more and more of its users (i.e., rows); each instance is associated with a single exception to incorporate and generates a Max-SAT encoding of growing size.

![H_ResponseTime](img/H_responseTime.png)

The figure below shows the minimum timeout needed to obtain a feasible solution for these inputs as a function of their size. Minimum timeout needed to compute feasible solution to _Firewall1_ (y axis, secs) as a function of the number of users (x axis). Along the x-axis we also note the size of the corresponding CNF formula. The results are also available in plain text in [Results.txt](dataset/complexity/Results.txt)


### Quality of incomplete solutions

Experiment based on _SmallComp_ dataset to measure the ability of the incomplete solver adopted to satisfy the soft constraints. In particular, this is computed as the average weight of satisfied soft constraints over the total sum of weights for the 12 exceptions. 

![rateSoft](dataset/img/rateSoft.png)

The figure above shows the average percentage of satisfied soft clauses (y axis) as a function of the balance B (c_axis) in the _SmallComp_ dataset

Results are also available in plain text in [rate.txt](dataset/Incomplete/rate.txt) which are based on the evalaution of the three configurations:
- complete solver [Results.txt](dataset/Incomplete/complete/Results.txt)
- incomplete solver (timeout 2 sec) [Results.txt](dataset/Incomplete/2/Results.txt)
- incomplete solver (timeout 180 sec) [Results.txt](dataset/Incomplete/180/Results.txt)
